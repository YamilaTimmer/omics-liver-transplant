### Introduction

This is a logbook for the Omics liver transplant project. The goal of this project is to perform a PCA on both the proteomics data and RNA transcriptomics data, and find a link.

## Reading the Paper

The paper selected for this multi-omics project is the *Bile proteome reveals biliary regeneration during normothermic preservation of human donor livers* @thorne2023

The paper looks at the effects of NMP (Normothermic machine perfusion) on livers that are to be transplanted that may not be in the optimal shape, meaning they have high biliary injuries (Traumatic damage to the bile ducts) or lower biliary viality (a lower ammount of living cells). The research was conducted on 55 livers that were deemed suitable for transplantation analysis. The livers came from ECD (extended criteria donors) and DCD (donation after circulatory death) donors.

To analyse the livers a multitude of samples were taken. Before the NMP 46 bile duct biopsies were taken, and 50 liver tissue biopsies were taken (these biopsies were taken before the livers underwent Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion - DHOPE) after undergoing DHOPE and COR (controlled oxygenated rewarming) The livers were put in the NMP where metabolic processes, bloodflow and simulation of other physioligcal conditions were started. 30 minutes after these livers were in the NMP a Bile sample was taken, this was taken of all 55 livers. At 150 minutes another bile sampes was taken of 54 (not 55 because one sample did not contain any proteins) livers. At this point in the NMP process all livers were analysed for a multitude of things to determine organ viability. The two distinct areas that were looked at were the hepatocellular vaibility, this focused on the metabolic funationality of the liver parenchyme (functional tissue of the liver, makes up 80% of the liver volume as hepatocytes), this is assesed by criteria such as lactate clearance and bile production. The other area was biliary viability that focuses on the functional capacity of cholangiocytes (epithelial cells of the bile duct) this was assesed by specific biochemical composition of the bile @thorne2023 . After the viability assesement was concluded 35 livers were viable for further NMP treatment pre transplantation, 20 livers were deemed non-viabel and therefore had their NMP stopped then being discarded. For the 35 livers that continued another sample of bile was taken at the END of the NMP treatment. However 33 samples were taken because of complications with 2 livers at transplantation.

The Bile, a very important part of this paper. But what is this bile? According too @boyer2013 bile consist out of a number of things \~95% of bile is water, Electrolyes, Organic Anions like Bile salts (Steroid/primary acids like cholic acid, chemodeoxcholic acid or secondary acids like deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) Lipids like cholesterol, Steroid hormons and estrogen. Proteins, peptides. heavy metals and others also are found in bile. For a more indepth look into what bile contains i would suggest reading table 1 in the @boyer2013 paper this gives the known composition of bile in most species.

The BDI, BDI meaning Bile Duct Injury is a metric that shows how much damage the liver has baised on 4 criteria. These being the presence of vascular lesions (abnormal growth or malformations in the bloodvessel), stromal necrosis (Organ tissue/cell death), Injury to the periluminal peribiliary gland and injury to the deep peribiliary glands. Using these 4 criteria a score was made called "a total histological bile duct injury score" this score ranged from 2 being the lowest to 14 being the highest with the median being 7. Using this previously mentioned median the livers were diveded into 2 groups. High BDI and Low BDI using this group system a number of analysis were made like seeing if BDI had influence of biliary viability.
