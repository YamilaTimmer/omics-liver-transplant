  abstract = "Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) after static cold storage is
              increasingly used for preservation and assessment of human donor
              livers prior to transplantation. Biliary viability assessment
              during NMP reduces the risk of post-transplant biliary
              complications. However, understanding of molecular changes in the
              biliary system during NMP remains incomplete. We performed an
              in-depth, unbiased proteomics analysis of bile collected during
              sequential hypothermic machine perfusion, rewarming and NMP of 55
              human donor livers. Longitudinal analysis during NMP reveals
              proteins reflective of cellular damage at early stages, followed
              by upregulation of secretory and immune response processes.
              Livers with bile chemistry acceptable for transplantation reveal
              protein patterns implicated in regenerative processes, including
              cellular proliferation, compared to livers with inadequate bile
              chemistry. These findings are reinforced by detection of
              regenerative gene transcripts in liver tissue before machine
              perfusion. Our comprehensive bile proteomics and liver
              transcriptomics data sets provide the potential to further
              evaluate molecular mechanisms during NMP and refine viability
              assessment criteria.",
